# üç≥ Recipe Buddy

Recipe Buddy is a SwiftUI iOS app that helps users browse, search, and save recipes, plan meals, and generate a shopping list ‚Äî all with an offline-first experience.  

## üöÄ How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rivaldofez/RecipeBuddy.git
   cd RecipeBuddy
   ```

2. **Open in Xcode**:
   - Open `RecipeBuddy.xcodeproj` in Xcode 15 or newer.

3. **Run the app**:
   - Select an iOS Simulator or a connected device.
   - Press `Cmd + R` to build and run.

No additional configuration is needed ‚Äî the app ships with a bundled `recipes.json` for offline use.

## üèó Architecture and Trade-offs

**Architecture**:  
- **MVVM** pattern with `Repository` abstraction for data access.
- **Repository Protocol** allows switching between local bundled data and remote JSON.
- **Async/Await** for async operations.
- State is managed with `@StateObject` and `@Published` properties.
- Image loader and caching using KingFisher library.

**Trade-offs**:
- **Persistence**: Chose `CoreData` for favorites, offline first, and meal plan
- **Offline-first**: Bundled JSON guarantees offline availability with cached in Core Data; remote fetch is first if available and falls back gracefully.
- **Ingredient quantities**: Basic string parsing for shopping list merge. More robust unit conversion could be added.
